1

I built a giant death trap, which is
just one of many traps we built.

2

And for every trap this contestant
survives, he wins $100,000.

3

But if he fails one,
he loses everything.

4

The first trap is simple.

5

He's got to break out of this cage

6

and climb up this roof
before the walls close in.

7

- Mack, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

8

- You sure?
- Do it.

9

That was a little rude, but okay.

10

How am I supposed to get out of this.

11

Mack, hey, you want a hit?

12

What?

13

The roof

14

Hey Mack,
don't forget a $100,000 is on the line.

15

Oh, my gosh.

16

It's getting so close to the spikes.

17

How does breaking the chair help?

18

Mack, come on.

19

Iâ€™m trying, Jimmy, shut up.

20

The wall is almost there. Mack, hurry.

21

Mack, come on.

22

Hurrry!

23

Come on, come on, come on.

24

You just won a hundred grand!

25

Yeah!

26

- But...
- Yes!

27

But I have a second trap
set up for you right now.

28

And if you risk this
hundred grand, you could win 200 grand.

29

Think on it

30

But I also don't have a video
if you don't say yes.

31

I'm doing it.

32

Let's go.
Mack may sound confident now,

33

but there are ten more traps
he has to get through

34

if he wants to walk out of this
with $1,000,000.

35

But first, let's see if he can win
200 grand.

36

Welcome to Trap number two.

37

Close the door.

38

Glad we were not under that.
In these duffel bags.

39

It's 200 grand in cash.

40

All you have to do to win it,

41

is press that red button
and go back to this door.

42

What happens when I press the button?

43

Just press it and find out.

44

You wanna come with me?

45

Oh, no. I'm staying,
I'm staying over here.

46

- Come with me.
- Go press the button.

47

In case you forgot

48

200 grand is on the line.

49

I don't know what's going to happen
when I push the button.

50

Just press the button

51

The dramatic lights.

52

I think you can see what the trap is.

53

If you touch a laser,
the door is going to slam closed.

54

Is there a time limit?

55

There's a touch of the laser
limit and it's one.

56

Bro, imagine if he just hit the first
laser.

57

This is not made for short people dude.

58

Oh my gosh.

59

I had a feeling
he would crawl on the floor.

60

That's why coming up,

61

There's lasers
literally straight in front of him.

62

I don't know how
I'm going to get past those.

63

- I'm gonna be honest.
- Oh, this is crazy.

64

Oh my gosh.

65

Oh, you're like,
surrounded by lasers.

66

Mack, I wouldn't move.

67

Jimmy, if I touch the laser.

68

How long do I have
before that door closes?

69

Less than a second.

70

Take a step to your left.

71

Take a step out of the way.

72

- Okay.
- Thank you.

73

Three, two, one.

74

Oh my gosh.

75

That was so...

76

I'm speechless.

77

Oh, yeah.

78

- Let's go!
- Don't celebrate yet.

79

Do you want to walk away with 200
grand or risk it for 300 grand?

80

I think I want to
do the next one.

81

Let's do it.

82

Unfortunately for Mack,
all of these traps get progressively

83

harder and harder to pass,
especially this next one.

84

Mack, come on in.

85

You're now in trap number three.

86

Bro, look how cool this is.

87

We literally spent the last 60 days
designing this set.

88

This is the $200,000
you've already won.

89

All you have to do here is grab

90

the next hundred thousand dollars,
and then all you got to do

91

is walk down this path and walk
right through this door.

92

What's going to happen
when I grab the money?

93

- Look around.
- It's over your head on this one.

94

Okay.

95

Starting to click for me
a little bit.

96

That was a little too obvious.

97

I'd say as soon as I picked up money

98

that boulder's coming straight for me.

99

And if you get ran over by the
boulder, I take my 300 grand back.

100

Oh, dude

101

I'm going to go over here so I don't get
squished by a boulder.

102

I want you to count me down
for three.

103

Three, two, one.

104

Go!

105

Oh, my God.

106

Go, go, go

107

You got to go.

108

Go, go, go.

109

Back off!

110

Not going to lie

111

You are much faster than I thought.

112

Oh, my gosh.

113

That boulder was right behind him.

114

Are you going to go for a fourth?

115

I don't know, Jim.

116

You're actually getting better.

117

If that thing hit me,
what would happen? Would I die?

118

Well, here's what happened to Nolan
when he got hit.

119

It hurts.

120

- I'm sorry, I just got to...
- Yeah, of course.

121

No, this is a big decision.
You should really think it through.

122

Okay, so what do you do?

123

- Okay, I'll do one more.
- One more?

124

- One more, yeah.
- All right.

125

Let's go see if
he loses 300 grand...

126

 or makes more money.

127

Don't phrase it like that, Jimmy.

128

Mack is now in a ball.

129

How's it feel?

130

I'm realizing
how bad I smell in this ball.

131

You chose this.

132

Open the door.

133

Welcome to trap number four.

134

For this trap, I made a life sized
video game that he has to complete.

135

Oh my gosh, dude.

136

To win 400 grand, all Mack needs to do
is complete this course.

137

In case it's not clear

138

If you fall down there in the foam,
you lose.

139

I see that.

140

Oh, yeah. One more thing.

141

You only have 5 minutes
to complete the course.

142

Okay.

143

First things first.

144

We have these little platforms.

145

Not too crazy.

146

This is so much harder in a ball.

147

Bro, if he's unironically
struggling with this,

148

Wait until he gets to all the moving
platforms of death.

149

This is not going to be easy,

150

Oh my gosh, dude.

151

Jump!

152

Jump?

153

Mack, be careful.

154

400 grand on the line.

155

Here, can I join you?

156

- Why? why?
- I don't know.

157

- Why?
- I'm sorry.

158

Because I want to be in the video.

159

It's my video.

160

This is terrifying

161

Up to this point, it's been pretty easy.

162

This is where it starts to get difficult.

163

This is where it's difficult?

164

It has not been easy.

165

Oh, this is crazy, dude.

166

Unlike the other challenges.

167

He's actually going pretty quick.

168

Balancing inside of this
ball is harder than it looks.

169

It multiplies all of your movements,
meaning you can fall at any time.

170

This ball is so hard to balance in.

171

Bro, it's 400 grand.

172

It's not supposed to be easy.

173

The obstacle so far in this trap are
nothing compared to the final stage.

174

This is where it gets really hard.

175

I couldn't have been more wrong.

176

Mack literally obliterated

177

the last stage of this course
in 10 seconds.

178

Oh my God!

179

That is what I'm talking about!

180

bro, whenever he wins,
I get afraid to be around him.

181

I don't know what to say when
I sketch this on a piece of paper.

182

It seemed a lot harder.

183

However, the traps that follow this one
are harder than anything

184

we've seen so far.

185

Answer the riddle.

186

What is better than 400 grand?

187

500 grand?

188

Are you going to be a wuss or
do you want a chance to win $500,000?

189

If the next one is going to be
as easy as this, let's run it back.

190

I didn't say it would,
but I'm going to take that as a yes.

191

Next trap.

192

Which Mack is going to need
a bathing suit for because...

193

It might involve some swimming.

194

Jimmy, what is this?

195

Mack, hop in this water real quick.

196

Mack, do you have
any idea what you're doing?

197

Not really.

198

Okay. This trap is hard, but simple.

199

When I say go, your money will be
pulled towards that massive bonfire.

200

 To stop it
You need to pull that lever.

201

And to get there, you'll have to swim
through this underwater chamber

202

and pick the locks of all four doors
in your path.

203

Got it.

204

You're probably wondering,
why am I holding a clothes hanger?

205

Because that's
how you pick the locks.

206

- Mack, are you ready?
- I'm ready!

207

Three, two.

208

Oh, wait, Mack,
could you fix that thing behind you?

209

All right, the timer has started.

210

This money in exactly 3 minutes,
it's going to be in that fire pit.

211

Unless Mack comes out the other end,
and flips that lever.

212

He's struggling right now.

213

How is he holding his
breath this long?

214

So Mack just unlocked the first lock.

215

You got this, Mack.

216

And while he's competing
for half a million dollars,

217

I want to tell you about
Stumble Guys.

218

A free to play multiplayer game
where you basically compete

219

against random people
in knockout games

220

and whoever comes out on top wins
the crown.

221

Every time Mack unlocks the lock,
he goes deeper

222

and deeper into the water,

223

which means he has less and less time

224

to pick his locks as he has to
come back up to the surface for air.

225

That is so hard to see.

226

Bro, this is crazy.

227

 Stumble Guys even took
some of our biggest videos

228

and turned them into levels
in the actual game.

229

And on top of that, Stumble Guys
now has MrBeast skins, emotes

230

and even victory animations
available inside their item shop.

231

He got the third door open.

232

There's also a special MrBeast-themed event
coming soon on Stumble Guys,

233

so make sure you download an iOS,
Android or Steam

234

for free right now.

235

All right, Mack. One more door.

236

Bye bye.

237

Look how close the money is
to the fire.

238

He is almost done,
I think he just opened the fourth gate.

239

Pull the lever.

240

You got to pull the lever!

241

You just stopped the money!

242

Oh, my gosh.

243

I hate you.

244

You might be a little lightheaded from
the lack of oxygen.

245

I could barely see.

246

I know, see that 500 grand
floating right there?

247

Do you want to risk it for 600 grand?

248

Full transparency.

249

The next trap.

250

It's probably the easiest trap
of all.

251

I'm serious.

252

If you were to ever stop,
I don't think now is

253

when you would want to stop.

254

- All right, let's do it. I'm in.
- Yeah?

255

- Yeah yeah, let's go.
- That could have been a lie.

256

What?

257

I was, in fact, not lying.

258

Anyone with a developed prefrontal cortex

259

should be able to pass this next one.

260

Welcome to the next trap.

261

This, in theory, should be the
easiest 100 grand of your life.

262

Okay, I need you to pick either
a Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar

263

One needs to go in the trash

264

- There we go!
- Yeah!

265

I will never eat that.

266

- Disgusting!
- Well of course...

267

Cause you just won
a hundred grand.

268

That's right.

269

Now you have $600,000 in cash.

270

- Jimmy that's six lamborghinis
- And a Feastable bar.

271

I'll throw that in.

272

Thanks.

273

Do you want to risk this $600,000

274

Mini ocean of money

275

For the chance to win $700,000?

276

You're crazy.

277

I can tell he's about to say yes.

278

I donâ€™t knowâ€¦

279

Dude, my mom is gonna be so mad
at me if I lose this right now.

280

Yes or no?

281

Just one more. What's one more?

282

- All right, let's do it. Yes.
- All right.

283

One more.

284

I actually though.

285

Please do not let me do
one after that.

286

- Okay.
- Okay.

287

Well, where we're going on this next trap,

288

Mack is going to need a blindfold.

289

All right, can you see?

290

I cannot see.

291

That was a lie.

292

All right,
maybe actually two blindfolds.

293

I hope he's not scared of heights.

294

And if you're wondering
why I said up heights earlier...

295

Well...

296

Send us up!

297

Oh, we're going up.

298

No, no, no, no, no.

299

Mack may know that we're going up,
but not how far

300

Oh my God, dude.

301

We're going 200
feet in the air,

302

where he's going to have
to face his biggest fear

303

If he wants to walk away with 700
grand

304

Mack...

305

let's take off the trash can.

306

Heads up!

307

Mack...

308

Welcome to the next trap.

309

I hope you're not afraid of heights.

310

I'm scared, bro.

311

Dude, that looks terrifying.

312

The next trap is simple.

313

All you have to do is walk
to the other side

314

on this absurdly thin balance beam.

315

Okay, this is insane.
Oh, my gosh.

316

I just don't know how
he's going to do this.

317

I'm so scared right now.

318

 I'm so scared.

319

Bro, this is terrifying.

320

- I don't... Would you do this?
- Oh, heck no.

321

I would never do this.

322

700 grand down the line.

323

His worst fear.

324

Let's see what happens.

325

Okay. I can't think about anymore.

326

It is what it is.

327

There. Oh, he's definitely
at the point of no return.

328

Karl, don't move...

329

Oh my gosh.

330

Holy crap. Heâ€™s making itâ€¦ Oh!

331

No way.

332

Yeah!

333

- Yes!
- Yes!

334

- Yes!
- Oh my God!

335

That's what I'm talking about.

336

That's what I'm talking about, baby.

337

Oh my God, dude.

338

Based on the first couple of steps,
I did not think he was going to make it

339

As requested,

340

I will not try to influence you.

341

Do you want to walk away
with your 700 grand

342

or risk it and keep going for
the million dollars your decision?

343

I have the opportunity right now to
leave with just an insane amount of money.

344

But...

345

I'm just...

346

I'm just so close.

347

I just feel like everyone at home
wants

348

to see the next three challenges,
right?

349

I do.

350

Final answer.

351

I'm going to the next one.

352

Yeah!

353

If he fails the next trap,

354

I'm going to feel terrible.

355

Mack now only has three traps

356

remaining to win $1,000,000,
but it only gets harder from here.

357

You decide to risk the money.

358

- Let's do this.
- I'm so scared.

359

Lights on!

360

This next
trap may look a little familiar

361

Our most viewed video is Squid Game

362

So I thought it would be fun
if we combined the glass bridge game

363

with the cookie cutting game
all into one trap.

364

Just like in Squid Game,
you have a honeycomb here.

365

You have to cut out the shape
that's there and put that exact

366

shape on the scanner.

367

If you break the cookie,

368

it won't fit in the circle
and the bridge will drop you.

369

And I lose everything.

370

But if it's the exact same size,
the door will open

371

and you have to do it three more times

372

How much time to have?

373

There is no time limit.

374

- Thank God.
- No, but you've been...

375

- Thank God!

376

Some of these challenges, he takes an hour.

377

so I might give you one.

378

- No, don't give me a time limit.
- Okay, well, can you just at least start?

379

Okay. A strategy. Jimmy,
is I lick this boy.

380

And that's going to melt the sugar.

381

And then ideally, I can poke this
needle through this cookie.

382

So your strategy is Squid Games.

383

That's the way to put it.
Yeah.

384

- Mack.
- Get away from me.

385

- I didn't touch you.
- You need to stay over there.

386

What about my croc?

387

No. Well, now I don't have a shoe.

388

It's the only way to teach you, man.

389

All right, here we go.

390

It's taking forever.

391

I understand that this money
is essentially meaningless to you.

392

Me? This will change my life.

393

So I'm going to take my sweet time
cutting the circle out.

394

You can take your sweet time.
Take your sweet time

395

Just the next one.

396

I'm probably going put a time limit.

397

No!

398

Halfway done.

399

That's it, right?

400

Okay, put it there.

401

You're good.

402

Light's on.

403

He's going to solve the triangle
pretty easily.

404

But after the triangle is a star
and an umbrella which are way harder.

405

Okay.

406

 Cookie.

407

Also, wait, wait.

408

Before you open it.

409

One second.

410

Oh, no,

411

I'll replace that because the money
was so far away I moved it over here.

412

In case you forgot what you're
competing for.

413

- Part of it's really far away.
- I will replace it.

414

Okay.

415

You can proceed.

416

For the record,
I regret saying yes to this.

417

- Really?
- Yeah.

418

At this point see how sad you are
at the thought of losing?

419

I would actually highly recommend
if you win to walk away after this.

420

That's what I thought after
I finished the high ropes course.

421

That's what you thought after every trap,

422

But yet, we're here.

423

Wow, that's just sliding off.

424

Last piece.

425

Oh my gosh.

426

I think he did it.

427

Okay.

428

Walk on in here.

429

Cookie us.

430

Now comes the real challenge.
Umbrella.

431

The hardest shape.

432

If I win this, I don't think
I should risk it again, dude.

433

All right, how about this?

434

Cut this stupid umbrella out and then
just take the money for my sanity.

435

For my sanity, dude.

436

Okay.

437

Oh, and by the way,
this one has a ten minute timer.

438

- Okay, it's ticking right now?
- Yeah.

439

9 minutes and 50 seconds
remain.

440

I love you.

441

I will not be speaking to you
while I'm doing this.

442

I completely understand

443

$800,000 is on the line.

444

Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money.
Give it to me.

445

Stack, okay.

446

He's using the money as a hammer.

447

They didn't do that in Squid Game.

448

I've never felt more intensity
in my life.

449

This is very, very difficult.

450

I don't know what I'm going to do
with myself if I lose this.

451

5 minutes remain.

452

Honestly, I think you can do this.

453

I feel like
I'm going to break it, dude.

454

Shoe hammer

455

Dude, I'm just making no progress.

456

2 minutes.

457

He's starting to break it off.

458

He's starting to pull pieces of.

459

Just so you know,
there's 60 seconds left Mack.

460

Wait, what just happened?

461

Oh, no.

462

I actually don't know what to say.

463

I'm such an idiot, dude.

464

And I had it all.

465

It's $700,000.

466

I don't know why I did
this.

467

Would it have hurt less
